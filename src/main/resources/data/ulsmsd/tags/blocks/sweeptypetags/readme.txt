This folder contains tag sets that define the loot tables for blocks when swept.
For example, grass yields dirt so teh tag is sweep_dirt, and cobwebs drop string so it sweep_string. 
All tags follow the naming convention sweep_(name).
Every sweepable item needs a sweep time and a sweep type and a sweeptier tag.
