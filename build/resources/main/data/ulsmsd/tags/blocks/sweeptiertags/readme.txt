This folder contains tiers for sweeping. 
Each block that can be swept is assigned a tier, and if you attempt to sweep it with a broom of a lower tier, the sweeping time is multiplied by 4 for each tier difference. 
For example, trying to sweep a tier 3 block with a tier 1 broom will take 16 times as many sweeps.
Every sweepable item needs a sweep time and a sweep type and a sweeptier tag.
