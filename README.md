# MinecraftSweepingDetail
MinecraftSweepingDetail brings sweeping up things to the forefront as a core mechanic in a vanilla+ style! With satisfying sounds, you can sweep up dust and trash piles using brooms, collect rare materials, and even craft your very own janitor’s outfit.

## Sweeping Features
You can sweep dirt! You can sweep sand! You can even destroy cobwebs!
Sweeping things also grants useful loot, with some items being biome-specific. For example, sweeping in a riverbed might yield coal. The mod introduces trash blocks of varying rarities that provide different rewards when cleaned, making sweeping a valuable part of survival gameplay. Dust will also accumulate inside your buildings, requiring regular cleaning to prevent it from slowing your movement or affecting your health.

## Seamless Integration
No intrusive UI—just you, your broom, and some action bar text! It fits perfectly into any vanilla+ modpack without disrupting the game’s natural flow.
