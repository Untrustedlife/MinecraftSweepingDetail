# MinecraftSweepingDetail
MinecraftSweepingDetail brings sweeping up things to the forefront as a core mechanic in a vanilla+ style! With satisfying sounds, you can sweep up dust and trash piles using brooms, collect rare materials, and even craft your very own janitor’s outfit.

## Sweeping Features
You can sweep dirt! You can sweep sand! You can even destroy cobwebs!
Sweeping things also grants useful loot, with some items being biome-specific. For example, sweeping in a riverbed might yield coal. The mod introduces trash blocks of varying rarities that provide different rewards when cleaned, making sweeping a valuable part of survival gameplay. Dust will also accumulate inside your buildings, requiring regular cleaning to prevent it from slowing your movement or affecting your health.

## Seamless Integration
No intrusive UI—just you, your broom, and some action bar text! It fits perfectly into any vanilla+ modpack without disrupting the game’s natural flow.

## Extensibility
This mod is designed to be highly customizable, working almost entirely through block and item tags. This means it’s incredibly easy to add new types of brooms, configure which blocks can be swept, and tweak things to your heart’s content. Want dirt to drop more loot? Simply modify the loot table.

The mod even provides some unused "templates," like blood and slime, which can be added to if your mod includes those elements. You can easily add new tags, and sweep times can be customized by adding new tags—as long as you use the correct mod ID. It's built to be flexible and adaptable for any modpack or custom content you have in mind.
